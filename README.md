# Crypotcurrencies

## Overview
The purpose of this project is to use unsupervised machine learning to analyze cryptocurriences.
The dataset is 'crypto_data.csv'
- Deliverable 1: Preprocessing the Data for PCA
	- See 'crypto_scaled' in the 'crypto_clustering.ipynb'
- Deliverable 2: Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA
	- See 'pcs_df' in the 'crypto_clustering.ipynb'
- Deliverable 3: Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means
	- See 'clustered_df' in the 'crypto_clustering.ipynb'
- Deliverable 4: Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results
	- See 'fig' and 'plot_df' in the 'crypto_clustering.ipynb'

## Results

Through using K-means it was found that the 'best' cluster number for this dataset was 4.
Visualizing the clusters the majoritiy are clustered into 2 groups (class 0 and class 3).
There are currently 532 tradeable cryptocurriences in this dataset.
The majoritiy of coins less than 0.2% of the total supply minned. This seems to be an out of date dataset.
